Recent graduate of Maker's Academy - a leading web development bootcamp. I'm looking to begin my career as a Junior Full-Stack Developer.

Like many Makers, I made the decision to change careers and jump (headlong!) into programming. 

I started out doing a Bachelors degree in English & Related Literature. My focus was on Classics and Homer, and I spent a lot of evenings reading about unnecessarily obscure literary theories. My first career was in event production. As a result, I have a really interesting/eclectic interal landscape of London (punctuated with many stressful and last-minute visits to Screwfix, and one particular memory of hauling a Henry the Hoover around Seven Dials at midnight). Some of the events that I'm most proud of were hosted at the BFI & the Royal Albert Hall, plus a fun stint working on an Audible podcast. 

I decided to take the leap into programming when I realised how endless the opportunities for creativity are. After seeing the events world, it was a revelation to me that ideas could be brought into existence using no resources other than time, thought and a laptop. 

I would love to work in an environment that will encourage me to maximise my learning, challenge me, and help me to grow and improve.

1. [SpotiVibes](https://github.com/mirimichaelson/spotiVibes) |	Our final project at Maker's. All four of us were passionate about music, and hugely excited at the idea of creating an app which we could use in day to day life.  SpotiVibes will take in either a word or an image given by a user, determine its sentiment, and connect to the Spotify API to return a song in that same vein of feeling. | 	React, Node, Express, Sptofiy API, Google Cloud Vision API, Google Cloud Language API |	Jest
2. [Maker's Bnb](https://github.com/samlandman/Makersbnb) |	With 5 weeks of coding experience, 5 Makers worked to create a clone of Airbnb.	| Ruby, HTML, CSS, Postgresql, ElephantSQL, Sinatra, Selenium-Webdriver, Bcrypt | Rspec, Capybara
