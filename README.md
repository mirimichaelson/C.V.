Recent graduate of Maker's Academy - a leading web development bootcamp. I'm looking to begin my career as a Junior Full-Stack Developer.

Like many Makers, I made the decision to change careers and jump (headlong!) into programming. 

I started out doing a Bachelors degree in English & Related Literature. My focus was on Classics and Homer, and I spent a lot of evenings reading about unnecessarily obscure literary theories. My first career was in event production. As a result, I have a really interesting/eclectic interal landscape of London (punctuated with many stressful and last-minute visits to Screwfix, and one particular memory of hauling a Henry the Hoover around Seven Dials at midnight). Some of the events that I'm most proud of were hosted at the Royal Albert Hall, the BFI & the Palladium, plus a fun stint working on an Audible podcast. 

I decided to take the leap into programming when I realised how endless the opportunities for creativity are. After seeing the events world, it was a revelation to me that ideas could be brought into existence using no resources other than time, thought and a laptop. 

I would love to work in an environment that will encourage me to maximise my learning, challenge me, and help me to grow and improve. 


## Projects


Project	| Summary |	Technologies |	Testing
-------- | --------  | -------- | --------
[SpotiVibes](https://github.com/mirimichaelson/spotiVibes) |	Our final project at Maker's. All four of us were passionate about music, and hugely excited at the idea of creating an app which we could use in day to day life.  SpotiVibes will take in either a word or an image given by a user, determine its sentiment, and connect to the Spotify API to return a song in that same vein of feeling. See the app here! http://spotivibes.surge.sh/| 	React, Node, Express, Spotify API, Google Cloud Vision API, Google Cloud Language API |	Jest
[Maker's Bnb](https://github.com/samlandman/Makersbnb) |	With 5 weeks of coding experience, 5 Makers worked to create a clone of Airbnb.	| Ruby, HTML, CSS, Postgresql, ElephantSQL, Sinatra, Selenium-Webdriver, Bcrypt | Rspec, Capybara
[FishBook](https://github.com/stupot1/acebook-ciao-pescao)	| Facebook, but fishified! |	Javascript | Jest

## Experience

### Freelance Event Production (August 2019 - April 2020)
Before retraining, I worked as an event production freelancer. I worked on charity and radio events such as [the OnSide Awards](https://www.onsideyouthzones.org/onside-awards/) at the Royal Albert Hall with appearances from guests like Prince Harry & The Script, and the [ARIAs](https://www.radioacademy.org/arias/) at the Palladium, sponsored by companies like BBC Sounds & Audible. I also had the pleasure of working on the Audio Production Awards, and events like the Bvlgari Fashion Week launch at the Camden Roundhouse. 

Freelancing often requires you to think on your feet and be quick to pick up new ways of working. I've found this experience immensely helpful in my shift over to programming, particularly in learning new technologies in a short time frame. Working on my final project, spotiVibes, was a prime example of this. We had never worked with React or spent more than a day or two working with API's before. Suddenly our whole project required new technologies to be used, and we had to learn quickly and with confidence to achieve our goal. 

### Heaps + Stacks, Creative Event Production Assistant (January - August 2019) 

This was my first event job, and where I learnt the basics of event production. I worked largely on idea creation & presentations for pitches. Presentations took the form of intricately styled powerpoint presentations with a heavy focus on design. The time I spent working on these 'decks' improved my eye for design and spatial placement, and has fed into my focus & enjoyment of front-end design.

### TEDxFolkestone, Communications Volunteer (September 2018 - February 2019)

TED is a company that I've been inspired by for years, and still am to this day. I was really excited and grateful to spend some time volunteering with TEDxFolkestone to help them to organise their social media strategies on Facebook & Instagram. 

### SANE Communications, PR intern (September 2018 - January 2019)

Sane is a PR company which works with fashion brands, including Weekday & Maison Kitsune. After graduating, I spent some time trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I started out in PR, and my work there (and with SANE) introduced me to the world of events through evenings like the Weekday x NonViolence charity fundraiser.

### Vauxwall, Team Member (August 2018 - June 2019) 
My first job after graduating was with my local climbing wall in London where I had the pleasure of working with some amazing people, choking continuously on chalk dust, and teaching new climbers.
